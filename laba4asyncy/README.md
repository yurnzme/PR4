AsyncArray and CompletableFuture Example
This project demonstrates the use of CompletableFuture in Java to perform asynchronous operations. It contains two main classes:

AsyncArray: This class demonstrates how to asynchronously generate a 3x3 matrix, print the matrix, and display each column asynchronously while measuring the execution time for each operation.
CompletableFutureExample: This class showcases the usage of various methods from CompletableFuture, including runAsync(), supplyAsync(), thenApplyAsync(), thenAcceptAsync(), and thenRunAsync() to chain multiple asynchronous operations and process the result.
Features
AsyncArray:
Asynchronously generates a 3x3 matrix filled with random numbers.
Asynchronously prints the generated matrix.
Asynchronously prints each column of the matrix.
Measures and displays the time taken for each asynchronous operation.
CompletableFutureExample:
Demonstrates the usage of runAsync(), supplyAsync(), thenApplyAsync(), thenAcceptAsync(), and thenRunAsync() with simple operations.
Calculates and prints the total execution time of the asynchronous tasks.
Requirements
JDK 8 or later is required to run the program.
A Java IDE or a text editor with the ability to compile and run Java code (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code with Java support).
How to Run the Program
